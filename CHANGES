Version 2.0.0 - 3 March 2012
    Important Changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - 3 new submodules (binning, fitting, astroprofiles)

Version 1.9.9 - 9 January 2012
    Important Changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Change of the name to pyMGE
    - Cleaning and documentation in the routines

Version 1.9.2 - 2 September 2011
    Important Changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Cleaning: using kwargs in pymge
    - Removed many options which were unnecessary
    - Many changes of option names to make them more sensible

Version 1.9.0 - 30 August 2011
    Important Changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - The Dynamical Group were introduced
    - We now include a second Integer in the NPARTGROUP to specify how many
    particles we wish (total) and how many to realise.
    - We can now specify the number of particles we wish to realise for a
    specific model, and where to start. This should allow large simulations to
    be realised in chunks. This uses the keywords FirstRealisedPart and
    nMaxPart.

    Bug fixes
    ~~~~~~~~~
    - the expression for black holes has been changed at large radii (coefficient was wrong)
